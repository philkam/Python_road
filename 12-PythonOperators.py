#Python Operators
#operators carry out arithmetic or logical computations. Operations are performed on variables and values
#They are:
"""Arithmetic Operators: Used with numerical values to perform mathematical operations. eg. + and -
    Assignment Operators : Used to assign values to variables  eg. = and +=
    Comparison Operators  : Used to compare two values  eg. == and !=
    Logical Operators   : Used to combine conditional statements eg. and as well as or
    Identity Operators  : Used to compare the objects not if they are equal but if they are the same eg. is and is not
    Membership Operators  :   Used to test if a sequence is presented in an object eg. in and in not
    Bitwise Operators:  Used to compare binary numbers eg. AND (&) and OR (|) and XOR (^)
