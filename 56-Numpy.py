#Overview
#Numpy is a free python library that is equipped with complex mathematical operations that are suitable for processing
#statistical data.
#All data is stored in NumPy Arrays.

#Intro
"""
-It means numerical python. it is a must for scientific computing.
-The main component is the NumPy N-dimensional Array (ndarray)
"""

#Usages of Numpy
"""
- Faster than python arrays
-N-dimensional arrays by nature. Optimised and easier to work with more complex data
-Dozens of built-in functions.
Uses: scientific domain, dozens of third-party libraries, data science, machine learning, visualisation"""
