#When to use each data type in Python
"""List: USe lists when we do not have any special cases that we want to take care of,
and we want our list to be ordered for indexing.
Tuples: Usge tuples only when we are sure that the values inside them should not be changed no matter what,
so this is the best way to assure that.
Dictionaries: Use dictionaries when we want to have some sort of relation between some unique
variables and other non-unique variables,as we only concerned with the key
Sets: Use sets when we know that any repeated data will be redundant. So, sets can be very efficient in ignoring redundant data and
increase the performance of any algorithm
