#Naming variables is a good practice. Name variables with meaningful names.

#Python reserved keywords  can't be used to name variables. Example: if, for, while etc.

#Python is case-sensitive. X is not the same as x.

#Variable names should be lowercase, with words separated by underscores as neccessary to improve readability.
#example: age , student_id.


print (5 + 9)
#You can't get access to the answer after you have computed it. it will be lost in memory because no variable is used but
# x belows stores the value of the operation

x = 5 + 8
print(x)

# x can be reused for other purposes. That's why variables are necessary
print(x - 4)
