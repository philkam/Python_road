#Decorators
"""
-It's a function that takes another function as an input
-So, it's considered as a higher-order function, like the map and filter functions we discussed
-It extends the behaviour of the input function, without modifying it.
"""

#Inner Functions
"""
-We can define functions inside other functions
-We call these functions inner functions
-We can't call the inner functions because they are defined inside the outer functions
-The code will throw an error
-We can return an inner function inside the outer function
-We will return in fact the reference of this function so we will not have parenthesis
"""

#Decorators: They wrap a function and modify its functionality. It's almost the same as inner functions

#Pie Syntax
"""
-@ symbol is used to wrap function to prevent it from being unnecessarily messy"""

#Reuse Decorators
"""We can reuse the decorators you created to work with any function"""
