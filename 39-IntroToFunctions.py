#Functions
#Functions take some inputs, do some logic on them, and return an output.
#Python is built around functional programming and OOP.
#Imagine that you want to calculate the sum of two variables.
#What if you want to repeat the process the multiple time?
#You want to have it as a function in your code so as to make the repetition easier.
