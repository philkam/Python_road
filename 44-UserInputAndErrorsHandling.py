"""Error Handling -  Python program terminates as soon as there is an error. Error handling will make us understand how to

Syntax Errors: The code won't run under any condition.

Exception: Can happen if there are no syntax errors. Code will stop if some condition happens.
            We need to catch and handle this condition, so the code wont stop.
