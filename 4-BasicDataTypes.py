type() function- it ascertain the data type of a certain value. type(123) returns <class 'int'> meaning integer

Mutable and Immutable objects: 
Immutable means their contents cannot be altered after creation. Number values, strings and tuples are immutable
Mutable means the collection of items can be modified. Dictionary and list are mutable. Mutable items can be added, deleted, 
inserted, rearranged etc"""
